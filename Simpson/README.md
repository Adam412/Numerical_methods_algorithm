# Simpson
## Description
 Uses Simpson 1/3 rule to estomate the integral of the array. if the number of intervals is odd the algorithm employs the trapizotal rule on the last intgerval.
 ## Inputs
 * **x**-independent variable of data array
 * **y**-dependent variable of data array
 ## Outputs
 * **I**-the estamated integral from simpson 1/3 rule and/or trapizotal rule
 ## Limitations 
 * The simpson 1/3 and trapizotal rule have errors and are not exact
