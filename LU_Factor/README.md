# luFactor
## Description
* This algorithm takes a matrix and finds the lower, upper,and triangular matrix. The matrix pivats the corfficient matrix then uses gauss elimination to solve for the upper triangular matrix then uses the factos to get the lower triangular matrix while pivoting.
## Inputs
* **A**-coefficient matrix
## Outputs
* **L**-lower triangular matrix
* **U**-upper triangular matrix
* **P**-the pivot matrix
## Limitations
* This alorithems use partial pivoting and can contain subtraction errors and rounding errors.
